<div id="main" class="instruction" style="width: 100%; height:1000px;">As a first step towards this aim the creation of a complex relational database and the compilation of prosopographical data has begun at the outset of the project by incorporating all data entries of a so far unpublished card box collection that has been compiled by Dietrich Raue since the 1990s; it comprised 1121 individuals: 878 male and 243 female persons.

Based on the card box collection, the data has been supplemented with information from preliminary reports and final publications as well as additional relevant studies and collection catalogues. Monuments and artefacts from altogether 114 museums and collections all over the world have been included to the data collection. 
In order to record all relational data, a complex relational database model has been created using PostgreSQL. The relational model of the database management is m:n and 1:n. A n:m relation is used to denote a many-to-many relationship, where m-objects on the one side are related to n-objects on the other side. In addition, 1:n relations refer to a one-to-many relationship, that means 1-object on the one side can be related to n-objects on the other side. That means every data entry of the table persons can be assigned to several other entries in the same table as well as in other tables of the same database system. Thus, an individual can be assigned to different objects which bear witness of the same person. In addition, persons can be related to each other by different parameter (i.a. gender, genealogical or institutional affiliation or geographic origin), which forms the basis for creating personal networks. The high standardisation of the data form and structure enables an easy access as well as the application of external analysis software and visualisation tools, such as the network analysis software Gephi with its export plugins sigma.js and the TOMATILLO VizTool, see: Broux and Pietowski 2019) or Jupyter notebooks, which is an OpenSource interactive computational environment (IPython) for creating analyses and visualisations from existing data libraries. 
The data collection currently comprises 2370 persons, 1719 objects, and 974 titles, which are connected by more than 25,500 relations. This data set forms an amount of prosopographical data that has not yet been processed for the second millennium BC. To ensure the scientific transparency of the research argumentation, but also continuity of data editing respectively recording of new data, data storage and long-term provision of research results in a structured file format (JSON), the database will be provided as Open Access publication. All data can be downloaded under the license CC BY 4.0 as a database dump at https://zenodo.org/record/2547538#.XNfyC6bgq1s in the repository of Zenodo. The web interface is published on https://topoi.github.io/NavigatorVersion1/.
